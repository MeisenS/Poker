I didn't collaborate with anyone on this assignment.





since the deck is totally shuffled every single time so the two hands are just drawing 10 cards from the top of the deck, the first five cards are hand#1 and the second five cards care hand#2
directly execute the driver class, main method for the first three questions is in it.

since the last problem asks us for an additional driver class, its main method is in "anotherDriver" class 




the classify method in Functions class returns an array of integers, the first one is to get the classification number, the remaining five numbers are just used to deal with the situation where the two hands have the same categories.

otherwise, the method name in the Functions class pretty much explains what the method itself is trying to do.
